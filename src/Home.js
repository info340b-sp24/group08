      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Embarking on a journey of higher education in a foreign country is an
        important milestone filled with both opportunities and challenges for us
        as diverse international students in the United States. Securing
        employment is a significant hurdle, a challenge not unique to us, but
        shared by countless international students across the U.S. The
        complexities of different cultural norms, understanding the local job
        market, and dealing with restrictive work authorization laws add layers of
        difficulty. Based on our shared experiences and stories from our
        teammates, we have decided to dedicate this quarter's INFO 340 project to
        a cause closely related to usâ€”enhancing employment opportunities for
        international students.</p>
