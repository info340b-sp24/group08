          States to international students who wish to pursue academic studies
          and language training programs within the U.S. This visa enables
          students to study at accredited U.S. institutions, including
          universities, colleges, high schools, and language training programs.
          Holders of the F1 visa are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the
          duration of their academic program, plus an additional 60 days to
          prepare for departure or to transfer to another program.</p>

        <p class="lead" id="j1-visa-detail">The J1 visa is a non-immigrant visa provided by the
          United States to individuals participating in exchange visitor
          programs that promote cultural exchange, especially to obtain medical
          or business training within the U.S. This visa category includes a
          wide range of participants, such as students, research scholars,
          professors, specialists, interns, and au pairs. The J1 visa aims to
          enhance understanding between the people of the United States and
          those of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges.
          Participants are encouraged to share their culture with Americans and
          to take their enriched understanding of the U.S. back to their home
          countries.</p>

        <p class="lead" id="m1-visa-detail">The M1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued by the United
          States specifically for students who wish to pursue vocational or
          non-academic studies within the U.S. Unlike the F1 visa, which is for
          academic studies, the M1 visa is tailored for those enrolled in
          technical and vocational programs. Students on an M1 visa are
          permitted to stay in the country for the full length of their
          vocational program plus an additional 30 days for departure, but the
          total stay cannot exceed one year unless granted an extension for
          medical reasons.
