  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Embarking on a journey of higher education in a foreign country is an
    important milestone filled with both opportunities and challenges for us
    as diverse international students in the United States. Securing
    employment is a significant hurdle, a challenge not unique to us, but
    shared by countless international students across the U.S. The
    complexities of different cultural norms, understanding the local job
    market, and dealing with restrictive work authorization laws add layers of
    difficulty. Based on our shared experiences and stories from our
    teammates, we have decided to dedicate this quarter's INFO 340 project to
    a cause closely related to usâ€”enhancing employment opportunities for
    international students.</p>
  <h3>About InterStu Spot</h3>
