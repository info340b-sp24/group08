            <h2>Problem Background</h2>
            <p>The increasing trend of adopting dogs as family members has brought to light a significant issue in China, where many first-time dog owners find themselves overwhelmed by the diversity of dog breeds. This often leads to the selection of pets that may not suit the family's lifestyle, resulting in dogs being abandoned or given away, subsequently increasing the number of strays and related public safety and health concerns. Moreover, there's a notable absence of platforms for dog owners to exchange vital information on dog care and training, further exacerbating the issue.</p>

            <h2>Intention</h2>
            <p>
                To address this, our proposal aims to create a comprehensive platform that serves both potential dog owners and current dog owners. This web-based solution will feature a filter-based recommendation system, tailored to assist potential dog owners in finding breeds that match their lifestyle and preferences. Additionally, it will offer detailed profiles for each breed, including temperament, size, and care needs. Additionally, we will offer a section dedicated to basic dog training, guiding owners through simple training routines to foster better behavior and strengthen the bond between them and their pets. To address the gap in community support, our platform will include a discussion board, enabling dog owners to share experiences, advice, and information about dog care, training, and any other relevant topics. This feature aims to build a supportive community of responsible dog owners, encouraging an exchange of knowledge that could significantly reduce the rate of dog abandonment and improve the overall welfare of dogs in China.</p>
