        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem Background</h2>
            <p>International students in the United States frequently encounter significant challenges in securing employment that aligns with their qualifications and career aspirations. These difficulties arise from a variety of factors including restrictive work visas, cultural and language barriers, limited professional networks, and a lack of government financial support. These obstacles not only hinder the personal and professional growth of the students but also limit the broader economic benefits that could be realized from harnessing global talent. Addressing these issues is essential for fostering a more diverse, dynamic, and inclusive economy.</p>

            <h2>Intention</h2>
            <p>
                To address this, our proposal aims to create a comprehensive platform that serves both potential dog owners and current dog owners. This web-based solution will feature a filter-based recommendation system, tailored to assist potential dog owners in finding breeds that match their lifestyle and preferences. Additionally, it will offer detailed profiles for each breed, including temperament, size, and care needs. Additionally, we will offer a section dedicated to basic dog training, guiding owners through simple training routines to foster better behavior and strengthen the bond between them and their pets. To address the gap in community support, our platform will include a discussion board, enabling dog owners to share experiences, advice, and information about dog care, training, and any other relevant topics. This feature aims to build a supportive community of responsible dog owners, encouraging an exchange of knowledge that could significantly reduce the rate of dog abandonment and improve the overall welfare of dogs in China.</p>

            <h2>Website Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our website offers a dynamic user experience that facilitates interaction with an extensive dog breed database, comprehensive care guides, and a vibrant community forum. These features are designed to support knowledge exchange and community building among dog owners. To address potential differences in technology access and cultural attitudes, we are exploring different features to make our content more universally accessible and relevant. First, interactive tools are integrated, including a breed recommendation system and personalized care tips based on user profiles, to increase engagement and ensure a tailored user experience. Leveraging big data analytics will allow us to refine our recommendations and ensure they meet the diverse preferences and needs of our audiences, thereby encouraging ongoing engagement and fostering a supportive online community.
            </p>
            <h2>Targeted Users</h2>
            <p>Our platform primarily caters to individuals exploring the idea of dog ownership, from those in the initial stages to those seeking concise and reliable dog care information. Additionally, it is designed to attract dog lovers interested in connecting with a community that shares their passion for pets. While our platform is designed to be inclusive, we recognize that access and cultural perceptions of pet ownership may differ among different groups. To enhance accessibility, we work on optimizing for different devices and languages. However, we acknowledge that differences in access to technology and different cultural attitudes toward pets may impact the level of engagement and perceived relevance of our platform for certain minority groups.</p>

        <section class="functionality">
            <h2>Website Information</h2>
            <p>Our users will have access to four key types of information: detailed breed profiles, comprehensive adoption guides, interactive community discussions, and essential dog ownership precautions. Each section is designed to provide valuable insights and practical advice, from understanding breed-specific needs to navigating the adoption process and engaging in responsible pet care practices. Our community forum encourages users to share experiences, ask questions, and offer support, enhancing the collective knowledge and support network available to every user. We aim to make our platform a one-stop resource for all aspects of dog ownership, enriching the user experience with valuable information and community support.</p>

        <section class="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                By centralizing a wealth of information on dog breeds, adoption processes, and ownership responsibilities, along with offering a platform for community interaction, our application stands as a unique and invaluable resource for potential and current dog owners. Users can personalize their experience by using our filter to look for dog breeds that match their preferences for temperament, size, care needs, and so on. The community discussion board further empowers users to exchange information, seek advice, and offer services like pet boarding, creating a comprehensive support network. Our goal is to simplify the pet ownership journey, making it more accessible and enjoyable for everyone involved. In doing so, we aspire to contribute positively to the pet industry and the broader community, fostering a culture of informed, responsible, and passionate pet ownership.
