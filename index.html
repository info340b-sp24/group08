        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem Background</h2>
            <p>International students in the United States frequently encounter significant challenges in securing employment that aligns with their qualifications and career aspirations. These difficulties arise from a variety of factors including restrictive work visas, cultural and language barriers, limited professional networks, and a lack of government financial support. These obstacles not only hinder the personal and professional growth of the students but also limit the broader economic benefits that could be realized from harnessing global talent. Addressing these issues is essential for fostering a more diverse, dynamic, and inclusive economy.</p>

        <section class="intention">
            <h2>Intention</h2>
            <p>
                To address this, our proposal aims to create a comprehensive platform that serves both potential dog owners and current dog owners. This web-based solution will feature a filter-based recommendation system, tailored to assist potential dog owners in finding breeds that match their lifestyle and preferences. Additionally, it will offer detailed profiles for each breed, including temperament, size, and care needs. Additionally, we will offer a section dedicated to basic dog training, guiding owners through simple training routines to foster better behavior and strengthen the bond between them and their pets. To address the gap in community support, our platform will include a discussion board, enabling dog owners to share experiences, advice, and information about dog care, training, and any other relevant topics. This feature aims to build a supportive community of responsible dog owners, encouraging an exchange of knowledge that could significantly reduce the rate of dog abandonment and improve the overall welfare of dogs in China.</p>

            <h2>Website Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our website offers a dynamic user experience that facilitates interaction with an extensive dog breed database, comprehensive care guides, and a vibrant community forum. These features are designed to support knowledge exchange and community building among dog owners. To address potential differences in technology access and cultural attitudes, we are exploring different features to make our content more universally accessible and relevant. First, interactive tools are integrated, including a breed recommendation system and personalized care tips based on user profiles, to increase engagement and ensure a tailored user experience. Leveraging big data analytics will allow us to refine our recommendations and ensure they meet the diverse preferences and needs of our audiences, thereby encouraging ongoing engagement and fostering a supportive online community.
            </p>
            <h2>Targeted Users</h2>
            <p>The target users of this website are international students in the United States who are navigating the job market. These students often face unique challenges due to visa restrictions, cultural differences, and limited local networks. The platform is designed to provide essential resources and support to help them secure employment and integrate successfully into the professional environment.</p>

        <section class="functionality">
            <h2>Website Information</h2>
            <p>Our users will have access to four key types of information: detailed breed profiles, comprehensive adoption guides, interactive community discussions, and essential dog ownership precautions. Each section is designed to provide valuable insights and practical advice, from understanding breed-specific needs to navigating the adoption process and engaging in responsible pet care practices. Our community forum encourages users to share experiences, ask questions, and offer support, enhancing the collective knowledge and support network available to every user. We aim to make our platform a one-stop resource for all aspects of dog ownership, enriching the user experience with valuable information and community support.</p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                To address the employment challenges faced by international students in the U.S., the website offers practical solutions such as a detailed visa information center, customized job listings that match visa status requirements, and professional development tools. These include resume and cover letter builders, interview preparation tutorials, and a platform for community discussions to facilitate networking and information sharing. This holistic approach aims to empower international students by providing them with the necessary resources to navigate the U.S. job market successfully, enhancing their ability to secure employment that aligns with their qualifications and career goals.
