    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Embarking on a journey of higher education in a foreign country is an important milestone filled with both opportunities and challenges for us as diverse international students in the United States. Securing employment is a significant hurdle, a challenge not unique to us, but shared by countless international students across the U.S. The complexities of different cultural norms, understanding the local job market, and dealing with restrictive work authorization laws add layers of difficulty. Based on our shared experiences and stories from our teammates, we have decided to dedicate this quarter's INFO 340 project to a cause closely related to usâ€”enhancing employment opportunities for international students.</p >
